                <p>I'm currently an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a> in Toronto, Canada.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 At York University, I'm pursuing a degree in Health Studies with a specialization in Health Informatics.</a>
                </p>

                <h2>Courses</h2>
                <p>
                  I am currently taking 3 courses this semester: HLST 2302, HH/HLST 3310 and ITEC 1010.
                <h2>Current goals</h2>
                <p>
                    I aim to prioritize my mental well-being by maintaining a consistent routine. This involves dedicating time to studying regularly and ensuring that the ongoing York strike does not deter my academic focus.
                </p>
  <h2>Why is my website empty?</h2>
<p>
    My website is currently empty because I'm still an undergraduate student. As I continue my studies, I'm working on developing it further. Stay tuned for updates!
</p>
<h2>Current activities</h2>
<p>
    While pursuing my studies, I am concurrently working part-time at Scott Library at York University. In this role, I assist patrons with locating resources, provide support with library services, and contribute to maintaining an organized and conducive study environment.
</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>
    As I continue to dedicate myself to studying diligently, I'm aware of the importance of building a strong foundation for my future. However, I also grapple with uncertainty regarding the direction my degree will take me. I am cognizant of the fact that success is not solely determined by chance, but rather requires careful planning and a touch of luck. Therefore, I'm committed to maximizing my competence to seize any opportunities that may arise in the future.
</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
    Thank you for visiting my website. I sincerely appreciate your interest and support. As we each navigate our own paths in life, I extend my warmest wishes to you on your journey. May we both persevere and achieve our dreams. Take care.
